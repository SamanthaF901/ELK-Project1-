# ELK-Project1-
## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the _YAML____ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly protected, in addition to restricting access to the network.
- _TODO: What aspect of security do load balancers protect? What is the advantage of a jump box?_

Load balancers protect the network system from DDos attacks. The advantage of a jump box is to provide additional security. 

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the jumpbox and system network.
- _TODO: What does Filebeat watch for?_

Filebeat watches for any file changes on the machine.

- _TODO: What does Metricbeat record?_
Metricbeat collects metrics from the operating system and from the services running on the server.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

| Name     | Function  | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|---------- |------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway   | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| Web-1    | Webserver | 10.0.0.5   | Linux            |                  
| Web-2    | Webserver | 10.0.0.6   | Linux            |                  
| ELK-VM   | Webserver | 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |                  

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the jump box provisioner machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- _TODO: Add whitelisted IP addresses_

My PC -  47.132.64.66 

Machines within the network can only be accessed by Jump-Box-Provisioner.

- _TODO: Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? What was its IP address?

Jump-Box-Provisioner â€“ 20.185.244.244

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 |   47.132.64.66       |
| Web-1    | NO                  |   20.185.244.244     |
| Web-2    | NO                  |   20.185.244.244     |
| ELK-VM   | NO                  |   20.185.244.244     |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- _TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?_

The main advantage of using Ansible is that it is a free and user friendly tool that simplifies several tasks such as application installation and configuration. 


The playbook implements the following tasks:
- _TODO: In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc._

-	Install docker.io
-	Install pip3
-	Install docker python module
-	Increase virtual memory
-	Download and launch a docker container

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

![TODO: Update the path with the name of your screenshot of docker ps output](Images/docker_ps_output.png)

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- _TODO: List the IP addresses of the machines you are monitoring_

Web-1  10.0.0.5
Web-2  10.0.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- _TODO: Specify which Beats you successfully installed_

Filebeats

Metricbeats

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- _TODO: In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., `Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._

Filebeats collects data about the file system.

Metricbeats collects machine metrics.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the YAML file to /etc/ansible/.
- Update the hosts file to include host group and ip address
- Run the playbook, and navigate to curl localhost/setup.php to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_

pentest.yml

/etc/ansible/

- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_

Update the /etc/ansible/hosts file to run the playbook on a specific machine.
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?
